# Palindrome
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")

**A palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as *madam* or *racecar* or the number *10801*. Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as *"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"*, *"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"* or *"No 'x' in Nixon"*.
